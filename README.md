# CareData

CareData is a blockchain-based web application where patients can store their medical records securely and access them easily. We are also providing many other features, like booking appointments with doctors online, online video consultations with doctors, booking appointments for lab tests, and a medical blog page that will instruct patients on how to stay healthy. (**The Web3 part has not been built yet!**)
